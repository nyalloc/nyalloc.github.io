[{"content":"Curiosity killed the cat Are you a C++ student? Do you want to explore all the vile Lovecraftian horrors that lie just beneath the surface? If you\u0026rsquo;d like to take that first brave step into the abyss, you\u0026rsquo;re in luck. I\u0026rsquo;m starting a series of articles called WTF is this? where I will expose newer programmers to the gritty, hair-raising monstrosities that I wish I had learned sooner.\nWhen I was a student, I felt like there weren\u0026rsquo;t a lot of resources out there that approached technical problems in a conversational, non-academic way. Personally, I learn best by getting my hands dirty, breaking things, and exchanging horror stories with my friends and colleagues. So, in this series I want to start deconstructing concepts that I really struggled to get my head around when I was studying. Some of my ideas include:\n WTF is an ABI? WTF is Dynamic Memory Allocation? WTF are Custom Allocators? WTF is Template Metaprogramming? WTF is Vulkan?  \rI think it could be really fun. Each article will introduce the concept, show some practical examples, and leave you with some more reading if you feel like digging into the concept further. The first one I would like to tackle is WTF is an ABI, this is a hot issue in the C++ community and it is one that has personally screwed me a few times now. Obviously like any good blog, I have no idea how often I can work on these. It\u0026rsquo;ll be out when it\u0026rsquo;s out‚Ñ¢Ô∏è.\nTa ta for now.\n","description":"A new series about gross code for curious newcomers!","id":0,"section":"posts","tags":["chat","wtf"],"title":"WTF is this?","uri":"https://nyalloc.io/posts/wtf-is-this/"},{"content":"New blog, who dis? Hello, my name is Stuart Adams. Welcome to my blog! I work at Codeplay Software as a Staff Software Engineer. I am a graduate of the University of the West of Scotland, where I studied Computer Games Technology. My main interests in programming are GPUs, graphics, and high-performance computing. I enjoy learning new low-level system APIs and using them to build cool tools and applications.\nIn my spare time I like to play games, develop games, write music and read. I recently started learning Japanese. Maybe if I get good enough I\u0026rsquo;ll start writing about my learning experiences.\nWhat is a \u0026ldquo;nyalloc\u0026rdquo;? In Japanese, nya „Å´„ÇÉ, means \u0026ldquo;meow\u0026rdquo;. I combined this with the C library function malloc to create nyalloc, a name that combines my love for code, cats, and Japanese pop culture.\n","description":"Stuart Adams","id":1,"section":"","tags":null,"title":"About","uri":"https://nyalloc.io/about/"},{"content":"Screaming into the void. Hi! I\u0026rsquo;m Stuart. Welcome to my new blog, where I will rant and rave about systems programming and other nonsense. Lately I\u0026rsquo;ve been trying to get caught up on next-gen graphics APIs, so a lot of my toy projects and experiments have been based around Vulkan and SPIR-V. I may also post about my hobbies and personal life, including game development, music and my cats!\nThanks for stopping by!\n","description":"Starting off the blog!","id":2,"section":"posts","tags":["chat"],"title":"Hello, world!","uri":"https://nyalloc.io/posts/hello-world/"},{"content":"Pictures of Ash and Bishop, my wonderful, mischievous cats! üêàüêà\n","description":"Photos of my cats!","id":3,"section":"gallery","tags":null,"title":"Cats","uri":"https://nyalloc.io/gallery/cats/"}]
