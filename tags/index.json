[{"content":"New blog, who dis? Hello, my name is Stuart Adams. Welcome to my blog! I work at Codeplay Software as a Staff Software Engineer. I am a graduate of the University of the West of Scotland, where I studied Computer Games Technology. My main interests in programming are GPUs, graphics, and high-performance computing. I enjoy learning new low-level system APIs and using them to build cool tools and applications.\nIn my spare time I like to play games, develop games, write music and read. I recently started learning Japanese. Maybe if I get good enough I\u0026rsquo;ll start writing about my learning experiences.\nWhat is a \u0026ldquo;nyalloc\u0026rdquo;? In Japanese, nya „Å´„ÇÉ, means \u0026ldquo;meow\u0026rdquo;. I combined this with the C library function malloc to create nyalloc, a name that combines my love for code, cats, and Japanese pop culture.\n","description":"Stuart Adams","id":0,"section":"","tags":null,"title":"About","uri":"http://nyalloc.io/about/"},{"content":"Screaming into the void. Hi! I\u0026rsquo;m Stuart. Welcome to my new blog, where I will rant and rave about systems programming and other nonsense. Lately I\u0026rsquo;ve been trying to get caught up on next-gen graphics APIs, so a lot of my toy projects and experiments have been based around Vulkan and SPIR-V. I may also post about my hobbies and personal life, including game development, music and my cats!\nThanks for stopping by!\n","description":"Starting off the blog!","id":1,"section":"posts","tags":["chat"],"title":"Hello, world!","uri":"http://nyalloc.io/posts/hello-world/"},{"content":"Pictures of Ash and Bishop, my wonderful, mischievous cats! üêàüêà\n","description":"Photos of my cats!","id":2,"section":"gallery","tags":null,"title":"Cats","uri":"http://nyalloc.io/gallery/cats/"}]
